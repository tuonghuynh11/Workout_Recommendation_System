Primarily, the back to wall shoulder flexion works on the mobility of the upper back and shoulders.
Proper warming up is critical, especially when it comes to the shoulder joint as it is active in the majority of movements putting it at a higher risk for injury.","
		Setup in a standing position with your back against a wall and your feet roughly 6-8 inches away from the base of the wall.

		Exhale and slowly raise the arms overhead as you try to touch your thumbs to the wall.

		Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		You may need to regress this drill to a supine position on the floor if you lack the anterior core control to complete it against the wall.

		Watch the elbow positioning as the arms raise overhead. If someone is “missing” overhead range of motion (which can be due to a variety of reasons, not just tissue restrictions) then they will likely compensate by bending the elbows.

		Be careful not to over cue the lats on the eccentric (lowering) portion. Aka don’t pull the elbows down aggressively, allow the forearms to slide down naturally while keeping the back musculature “quiet”.

		Ensure the low back stays relatively flat against the wall and the rib cage doesn’t flare as the arms go overhead.

		Make a double chin before you raise the arms as this will help to prevent the head jutting forward as the arms come fully into flexion.

		To make the exercise even tougher, add a full exhale at the top position to really drive activation of the abdominals and prevent the ribcage from flaring upward.

		If you’re a fairly kyphotic (flexed) individual then you may need to actually allow the shoulder blades to posteriorly tilt. Alternatively, if you sit in scapular depression, you may need to shrug slightly at the top to allow for complete upward rotation and optimal glenohumeral kinematics."

		If you find yourself leaning back or arching your back as you pull, utilize a half kneeling stance.

		As you pull, ensure the elbows stay high and the band remains at eye level.

		Focus on contracting the rear delts and ensure you don’t jut the head forward to meet the band.

		Ensure you set the band at face height rather than at the top of the machine as this may over recruit the lats and negate some of the scapular upward rotation benefits.

The exercise is a combination exercise that combines a traditional seated shoulder press with a seated behind the neck press. It also uses a partial range of motion to keep constant tension on the shoulders throughout the set.
Behind the neck press variations are often seen as a dated practice since they can put the shoulder in a compromised position, increasing the risk of injury.
If you do not have a fair amount of shoulder mobility, it is not recommended to perform this variation. And even if you do, depending on your reasoning behind the use of this exercise, there may be better variations available for you to use.","

		Repeat this cyclical process for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Reach tall at the top and don’t worry about keeping the shoulders packed down and back.

		Fight to control the bar from rolling your wrists into extension and think about “rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.”

		Keep momentum out of the movement and don’t add any additional leg drive by flexing and extending the knees.

		Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs as you press. You shouldn’t be leaning back excessively as you press.

		Imagine you’re trying to look out a window at the top, your ears should be in line with your biceps.

		If your shoulders are bothering you during the movement, consider experimenting with a wider grip or utilizing some of the vertical pressing progressions listed on the site."

		Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		To scale the movement, one may have to lower or raise the height of the rings. The closer you are to perpendicular with the floor, the tougher the movement will be.

		If regular repetitions with just bodyweight are too easy, progress by elevating the feet or adding a weight vest/plate to the torso. You can also use an old bookbag if you have it lying around but you should load this on the front of the body instead of the back as that can pull you into excessive extension.

		For other forms of progression, you can add fat grips or utilize single arm versions but just remember, this is about movement quality. Just because an exercise is hard doesn’t mean it’s better, work within your wheelhouse and don’t force progression if you haven’t mastered the fundamentals.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull.

		Keep the ribcage down and don’t focus on arching the back or forcing the chest up excessively.

		The leg closest to the wall should always be in flexion while the back leg will be in extension.

		Ensure that you are actually achieving a proper weight shift during the movement. Load into the back hip and then transfer your weight into the front hip as you rotate the hips and shoulders together.

		Push hard off the back leg and ensure that you rotate the hips around the front leg as you come through and finish.

		A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.

		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

		Push hard off the back leg and ensure that you rotate the hips around the front leg as you come through and finish.

		A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.

		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

By alternating the presses, you’ll work each side unilaterally, which can help build balanced strength and an aesthetically pleasing physique. It’ll also provide a core challenge as you fight to stabilize the body while alternating presses.","
		Assume a standing position with your feet shoulder width apart and arms by your sides holding a kettlebell in each hand.

		Clean the kettlebell to a front racked position.

		Press one kettlebell overhead until the shoulder reaches full flexion and the elbow is locked out.

		Slowly lower the kettlebell back to the starting position and repeat on the opposite arm.

		Repeat the alternating sequence for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Don’t allow the head to jut forward excessively.

		Ensure the hips stay stacked underneath the torso as you press, don’t allow them to shoot back as you press.

		Drive the bicep to the ear and exhale as you press.

		If you sense any pressure in your neck or traps during the movement, look to address a lack of thoracic spine extension or shoulder flexion.

		Keeping the elbows slightly bent at the top and not locking out entirely will help to keep tension on the shoulders.

		If you can’t lock out the elbows overhead then it may indicate a lack of shoulder mobility due to poor scapular upward rotation."

From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.
For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body.
By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.
Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way.
Some of these variations include:


		Incline bench press

		Decline bench press,

		Dumbbell bench press

		Dumbbell incline bench press

		Dumbbell decline bench press

		Smith machine bench press

Those with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.","
		Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat in order to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.

It will also indirectly work the muscles of the triceps and shoulders as well.
Chest dips effectively hit the lower region of the pec, similarly to the decline bench press. However, it follows a vertical pressing movement pattern, which provides a unique stimulus for the muscles of the chest.
It is best to master the bodyweight variation of this exercise prior to adding weight via weighted vests, belts, or chains.
The dip can be performed as part of your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, or full body workouts.","
		Step up on the dip station (if possible) and position your hands with a neutral grip.

		Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor.

		Control the descent to parallel and then drive back to the starting position by pushing through the palms.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technically there are two ways to perform dips - neither is wrong, just different movement with different purposes:


				Staying upright and keeping the elbows in close to increase tricep recruitment.

				Leaning forward with elbows wider to increase chest recruitment.



		If possible, keep the legs straight down while bracing the glutes and abs to limit excessive spinal movement.

		If no dip station with steps is available, position a box underneath the handles to boost yourself up to the bars.

		If no box is available, then jump into position.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward during the descent.

		Ensure the elbows stay just short of lockout to keep tension on the triceps.

		Experiment with a false grip by wrapping the thumb over the bar as this may be more comfortable for some."

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions or time.","
		Be careful not to get into the habit of ducking or crouching as you jump as this will alter your mechanics. If the rope is measured properly prior to jumping (see below for further instructions), then you won’t have any contract issues provided the movement occurs primarily at the wrist.

		Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand.

		Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially.

		Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.

		Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.

		There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.

		If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc).

The slight change in hand placement used in the wide grip incline bench press allows the lifter to place more emphasis on the chest muscle during the exercise, when compared to its closer grip counter parts.
The incline used in the wide grip incline bench press also allows one to target the upper chest better. This can be extremely beneficial if your upper chest is a lagging muscle group.","
		Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands well outside of shoulder width.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

Jumping rope in general requires and builds a lot of coordination, one of the most important components to human fitness.
Unilateral exercises are excellent options for working one side of the body at a time to help build balanced strength and an aesthetic physique.
Jump rope exercises, such as the single leg jump rope, are great calf building exercises as they provide a lot of repetition to the slow twitch muscle fibers of the calves and can be explosive by nature.","Grasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope behind your heels.
Rotate the wrists to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body.
As the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one leg to allow it to pass underneath.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions or time.","Hopping on a single leg requires quite a bit of hip and ankle stability. As such, if you encounter knee pain or you notice that your biomechanics are altered, consider utilizing a bilateral version and working to increase your single leg strength via training.
Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand.
Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially.
Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.
Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.
There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.
If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc).
Don’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions."

				The leg internally rotates (observe the kneecap or simply palpate the tib/fib complex as you complete repetitions)

				The heels rises off the floor

				The hips will rotate as they respond to rotation from the lower leg

				The knee hyperextends (if you feel pressure in the space between your hamstrings directly behind your knee, hyperextension is a likely possibility)

				The hips stay back as the individual rocks forward - this may present as an inclined torso or a hyperextended spine



		You can experiment with different knee positions to stretch certain aspects of the calf more than another. None are incorrect, just experiment and become aware of certain positions which might feel tighter than others and work to correct them over time:


				Leg slightly internally rotated

				Leg slightly externally rotated

				Leg neutral

				The hips will rotate as they respond to rotation from the lower leg

				The knee hyperextends (if you feel pressure in the space between your hamstrings directly behind your knee, hyperextension is a likely possibility)

				The hips stay back as the individual rocks forward - this may present as an inclined torso or a hyperextended spine

		Repeat on the other side.","
		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		Do not allow yourself to fall into overextension, keep tension through the abs.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.

		Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.

		Be careful when you roll near the head of the fibula (just below the base of the knee) as the common peroneal nerve passes through this region and can become aggravated.

		Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body.

		If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

		If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”."

		Lie flat on a bench and set your hands well outside of shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

Jumping rope in general requires and builds a lot of coordination, one of the most important components to human fitness.
Jump rope exercises, such as the skipping jump rope, are great calf building exercises as they provide a lot of repetition to the slow twitch muscle fibers of the calves and can be explosive by nature.","
		Grasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope behind your heels.

		Rotate the wrists to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body.

		As the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one foot to allow it to pass underneath.

		Once the rope has passed underneath, you’ll hop again with the same foot before hopping the rope with opposite foot on the next pass.

		Repeat steps 4 & 5 for the desired number of repetitions or time.","
		Skipping is essentially a rhythmic double jump on one leg but it is most often interpreted as a “bounce”. If you can’t seem to master the skip, try alternating hops first.


				Then focus on individual revolutions of the rope - allow the rope to rotate around your body, hop over it, hop again (aka the “bounce” commonly seen in skipping patterns), then rotate the wrists.

				It will feel somewhat staggered and disjointed but this form of segmentation (also known as “chunking”) is often necessary for motor learning with intricate skill sets.



		Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand.

		Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially.

		Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.

		Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.

		There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.

		If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc).

		Don’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions."

It is a variation of the dumbbell fly.
The added twist in the dumbbell twist fly provides an additional way to isolate the chest muscle and activates more muscle fibers than its traditional counterpart. Though, due to the additional twist, you may have to use slightly lighter weight than you would for normal dumbbell flys.","
		Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.

		To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, then press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.

		Slightly retract your shoulder blades, unlock your elbows, and slowly lower the dumbbells laterally while maintaining the angle at your elbow.

		Once the dumbbells reach chest level, reverse the movement by squeezing your pecs together. As the dumbbells are returning back to the starting position twist the handles so that the bottom of the dumbbells almost touch.

		Without allowing the dumbbells to touch, start the next repetition by untwisting the handles back to a neutral position, and continue until the set is completed.","
		Imagine you’re trying to hug a tree while completing the exercise.

		Don’t squeeze the dumbbell handles excessively tight as this can over recruit the forearms and biceps thereby reducing activation of the pecs.

		Avoid touching or banging the dumbbells together at the top of each repetition in order to keep constant tension on the intended muscle groups.

		Always keep a slight bend in the elbows and never lower the weight to the point where you get any sort of pain and pressure at the front of the shoulder joint.

		If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

It will also indirectly target the muscles of the shoulders and triceps.
The decline bench press is commonly used to target the lower portion of the pecs. However, some argue that it is the most effective bench press variation for targeting the entire chest.
Bench press variations can be included in your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.","
		Lie flat on an decline bench, set your hands just outside of shoulder width, and hook your feet underneath the pad.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to just below your sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

It is used by those who would like to focus on one side of their chest working at a time.
When performing the one arm dumbbell fly, it is important to start off with the weaker side of your chest. While the pec you’re not working will be recovering while performing the one arm dumbbell fly, it makes sense from a conditioning standpoint to work the weaker side first.","
		Pick up the dumbbell off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the end of the dumbbell in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.

		To get into position, lay back and keep the weight close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, then press the dumbbell to lockout at the top.

		Slightly retract your shoulder blade, unlock your elbow, and slowly lower the dumbbell laterally while maintaining the angle at your elbow.

		Once the dumbbell reaches chest level, reverse the movement by squeezing your pec and bringing the dumbbells back to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.","
		Imagine you’re trying to hug a tree while completing the exercise.

		Don’t squeeze the dumbbell handles excessively tight as this can over recruit the forearms and biceps thereby reducing activation of the pecs.

		Place your free hand on your ribcage to monitor spinal positioning or on your pec to improve mind/muscle connection through proprioceptive touch.

		Always keep a slight bend in the elbows and never lower the weight to the point where you get any sort of pain and pressure at the front of the shoulder joint.

		If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

		Keep your feet flat on the floor, focus solely on keeping your elbows bent and activating your pecs.

		Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to excessive arch."

When you perform SMR on your calves, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.","
		While in a seated position, position the tiger tail on the lateral aspect of the calf with one hand on either handle.

		Adjust pressure into calf by applying more or less force through the hands.

		Slowly roll up and down the length of the side of your calf for 20-30 seconds.

		Repeat on the other side.","
		The peroneals are located laterally to the calves and tibialis anterior so you may catch some of the peroneals when you are addressing these other soft tissue aspects.

		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.


				In addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.



		Foam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.


				HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.
Place the top of your right foot on the bench behind you. You are now in the starting position.
While maintaining your balance squat down through your hips by bending at the front knee.
Keep your torso straight and head up. Don't allow your front knee to track out over your toes.
Push yourself back to the starting position by using your heal to drive you.
Repeat this movement for desired reps and then repeat with your left foot on the bench behind you.",

		If you can’t get into a front rack position to front squat, then use the cross arm grip.

		Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

Box squats also serve rehabilitation purposes, especially for those coming off knee injuries or those learning how to eliminate the butt wink during squats.
However, in this particular exercise, the band resisted box squat would be used by the powerlifting community to train the top portion of the lift with a maximal load.
The added band resistance further overloads the top portion of the lift making the band resisted box squat the perfect option for those who have trouble at the top lockout of the back squat.","

		Lower yourself out of the calf raise and reach both arms overhead. Step forward into a lunge position and maintain an upright torso.

		Push back to the starting position and repeat on the opposite leg for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Keep the shin vertical during the forward lunge.

		As you lunge with the arms overhead, ensure the spine does not overextend and you don’t lean back.

		When you pull the foot up, ensure the knee stays pointed straight down. Often times folks will try to compensate for tight quads by allowing the knee to deviate laterally.

		This is a fairly advanced progression and should only be used when someone has gained adequate overhead and hip mobility coupled with core stability.

		This can also be used as a fairly comprehensive diagnostic tool and screening for coaches to observe compensatory patterns within athletes or clients."

		Catch the med ball as it returns from the wall and repeat steps #2-3 for the desired number of repetitions.","
		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

Don’t rush the progression scheme, earn the right to use every exercise and don’t neglect any of them.

When you go to push back to the starting position, fight the urge to lead the movement with your shoulders by hyperextending at your spine. Instead, look to drive the movement via force from your lower body.
Descend slowly and look to get a good stretch through your groin (adductor).
Exhale as you descend into the movement and keep the feet flat with the toes pointing straight ahead.
When first learning the movements, I would recommend you start with your feet already apart and then slowly move into each hip rather than taking a step out as this will take the deceleration component out of the movement.

		Push the tire over using your arms to complete the repetition.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Please note, in the starting position, your weight should be shifted forward into the tire and the heels slightly off the ground. The start position should NOT be a squat. It is a drive into the tire, not a pull with the arms.

		This movement should occur primarily with the legs, not the arms. It’s not a pull, it’s a push with the legs initially and then a push with the arms once the tire gets vertical.

		If you’re finding that your biceps tendon get irritated or inflamed the day after tire flips then you might want to consider that you’re overusing your arms and not enough of your legs.

		During the start position, one should have a fairly neutral spine and not allow their upper back to round. If you feel like you can’t get into position without rounding, it might be because you’re trying to squat the weight as opposed to the proper setup (see above)."

		The goal of box jumps is to generate full extension before landing on the box. Most folks focus on pulling their legs up as high as they can to jump onto higher boxes. Forget about the box height and focus on fully extending your hips.


				Jumping to a higher box doesn’t correlate to an improvement in vertical jump, it may mean that one can just pull their legs into hip flexion faster than someone else. Don’t mistake compensation for improvement.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Unilateral versions should only be incorporated once someone demonstrates substantial levels of lower body strength and stability.

		The arms drive the legs, don’t forget to incorporate the arm swing.

The split squat looks very similar to a lunge. However, the feet stay in one place for the most part during this exercise. Thus, some may refer to the split squat as a static lunge.
By holding the dumbbell like a goblet, as seen in the dumbbell goblet split squat, you are better able to keep an upright torso during the movement. This can be helpful for those who experience an excessive forward lean during other variations.","
		Select a dumbbell and position it at chest height with one hand under each edge of the dumbbell.

		Set up in a split stance position with your hands by your side looking straight ahead.

		Descend by flexing both knees simultaneously and continue until the back knee touches the ground directly beneath the hip.

		Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you return to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		If you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot.

		If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot.

		If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your neutral and load the front leg more effectively.

		If the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position.

		You don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement. On the contrary, you should have a slight forward lean and focus on keeping your lumbar spine neutral."

		Position your feet inside of shoulder width, extend your legs, and release the safety handles.

		Slowly lower the weight by bending your knees until your thighs are approximately at 90 degrees.

		Reverse the movement by driving into the platform and extending the knees and hips.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		To keep tension on the quads, keep the knees just shy of lockout.

		In order to emphasize the glutes more, push through the heels.

		In order to emphasize the quads more, push through the balls of the feet.

		Don’t allow the hips to posteriorly tilt and roll off the pad.

		Keep your low back flat against the pad throughout the movement.

		Ensure the head does not jut forward excessively.

Primarily, the dumbbell goblet box squat targets the quadriceps, but will also indirectly work the muscles of the hamstrings, calves, glutes, and core.
Box squat variations serve a couple of purposes. They can be used to help beginners learn the proper form of a back squat by providing an external cue to let lifters know when to reverse the movement.
Box squats also serve rehabilitation purposes, especially for those coming off knee injuries or those learning how to eliminate the butt wink during squats.
The dumbbell goblet squat can serve a similar purpose. They are also helpful in that they bring the weight in front of the body which can help lifters who struggle to maintain an upright torso during the squat.
All in all, the dumbbell goblet box squat is perfect for those rehabilitating from injury or learning the squat movement pattern.","
		Select a dumbbell and position it at chest height with one hand under each edge of the dumbbell.

		Take a deep breath and descend by simultaneously pushing the hips back and bending the knees.

		Experiment with a “false” (i.e. thumbless) grip as this helps to eliminate elbow and wrist issues in some folks.

		Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Imagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back.

		Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

		Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.

		If you’re having trouble with only driving off the front leg, then consider pulling up the toes on the back foot. This will shift the weight onto your heel and prevent you from driving off the ball of your foot.

		If you haven’t already, utilize the DB version first as the barbell version is a more advanced progression and you should master the basics first and foremost.

		Take care when utilizing a barbell variation (especially if training in an open area with others) as this version is a bit more dangerous and requires a larger area to work effectively.

		If you want to emphasize more of a pump through one leg versus another, complete all of the repetitions on one side before switching to the other.

		Do not rock forward to initiate the movement. Lean forward over the front leg, drive off the forefoot, control the eccentric, step off, and repeat."

				Single Leg Squat to Bench

				Lateral Lunge

				Bulgarian/Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat (RFESS)

				Single Leg Squat From Bench

				Walking Lunge

				Forward Lunge

				Single Leg Skater Squat

				Pistol Squat



		Don’t rush the progression scheme, earn the right to use every exercise and don’t neglect any of them.

		When you go to push back to the starting position, fight the urge to lead the movement with your shoulders by hyperextending at your spine. Instead, look to drive the movement via force from your lower body.

		Descend slowly and look to get a good stretch through your groin (adductor).

		Exhale as you descend into the movement and keep the feet flat with the toes pointing straight ahead.

The contralateral load used in the contralateral load front lunge provides a stability factor to the exercise and thus challenges the core.","
		Set up with your feet shoulder width apart and a dumbbell in the opposite hand as the forward leg.

		Step forward with one leg and allow both knees to bend simultaneously.

		Descend until the back knee touches the floor.

		Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you stand up fully and return to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Forward lunges are a more advanced progression and should only be utilized once one has the requisite hip and core stability. In general, a proper single leg progression scheme might look like this:


				Step Up

				Split Squat > Front foot elevated

				Reverse Lunge > Front foot elevated

				Single Leg Squat to Bench

				Lateral Lunge

				Bulgarian/Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat (RFESS)

				Single Leg Squat From Bench

				Walking Lunge

				Forward Lunge

				Single Leg Skater Squat

				Pistol Squat



		Don’t rush the progression scheme, earn the right to use every exercise and don’t neglect any of them.

		When you go to push back to the starting position, fight the urge to lead the movement with your shoulders by hyperextending at your spine. Instead, look to drive the movement via force from your lower body.

		In the bottom of the movement both of your legs should be at 90 degree angles at the knees.

		Keep in mind that with any sort of lunge or split squat pattern, if you want to emphasize the quads, focus on taking a slightly smaller step and drive up through the ball of the foot.

		If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during any sort of lunge or split squat pattern, focus on taking a slightly larger step and drive up through the heel of the foot."

The use of bands when performing reverse band box squats provides assistance while you’re at the bottom of the movement. This can be helpful if you’re trying to overload the top portion of the movement without fear of failing at your weaker part of the lift.
The box used in the reverse band box squats provides an external cue on when to reverse the movement. This can further limit the range of motion and keep constant tension on the top portion of the exercise.
Reverse band box squats are primarily used by the powerlifting community, but can be used by any training population looking to improve their overall squat personal record.","
		Position the bar just below shoulder level and adjust the safety stops right above knee height. Find a box set right at parallel and position 2-3 feet behind you. Once the bar has been loaded, attach bands to the top of the rack via pegs or the actual rack itself and then anchor the end of the bands around the bar to provide assistance.

		Place your pinkies on the smooth ring of the barbell.

		Get under the bar and position at the top of your rear deltoids.

		Unrack the bar, take 2-3 steps back and position your feet at shoulder width.

		Take a deep breath and keep your elbows in line with your torso.

		Descend by simultaneously pushing the hips back and bending the knees.

		Once your butt touches the box, begin to reverse the movement.

		Keep your abs braced and drive your feet through the floor.

		Finish the lift by exhaling as you fully extend the hips and knees.","
		Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.

		Bend the bar over your back by pulling it down into your traps.

		Experiment with a “false” (i.e. thumbless) grip as this helps to eliminate elbow and wrist issues in some folks.

		Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Imagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back.

		Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

		Drive your traps into the bar and try to squeeze your elbows in towards your body as you reverse the movement out of the hole.

		Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.

		Low bar positioning will require the lifter to sit back into the hips with more forward lean at the torso in order to recruit the posterior chain more effectively.

		If you don’t have access to a box then you can use a chair or a bench. Initially it might be wise to set the depth well above 90 degrees and then slowly work your way down.

		The goal of box jumps is to generate full extension before landing on the box. Most folks focus on pulling their legs up as high as they can to jump onto higher boxes. Forget about the box height and focus on fully extending your hips.


				Jumping to a higher box doesn’t correlate to an improvement in vertical jump, it may mean that one can just pull their legs into hip flexion faster than someone else. Don’t mistake compensation for improvement.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Unilateral versions should only be incorporated once someone demonstrates substantial levels of lower body strength and stability.

		The arms drive the legs, don’t forget to incorporate the arm swing.

By using a rack pin, as seen in the rack pin front squat, one can limit the range of motion and overload that specific portion of the movement. This can be especially helpful when training to overcome sticking points in certain lifts.","
		Position the safety stops at roughly waist height and then place the bar just underneath shoulder height.

		Position the hands just outside of shoulder width, step underneath the bar, and allow it to sit on the shoulders while driving the elbows high in front of the body.

		Take a breath and unrack the bar by pushing your hips forward and extending your knees.

		Take 2-3 steps back and position your feet just inside of shoulder width.

		Sit directly between your legs by simultaneously bending your knees and pushing your hips back.

		Once the bar touches the pins, begin to reverse the movement.

		Keep your abs braced and drive your feet through the floor.

		Finish the lift by exhaling as you fully extend the hips and knees.","
		Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.

		You can use either 2 or 3 fingers when front squatting in the front rack position as it will take some stress off the wrist.

		To keep the torso upright, focus on driving the elbows up out of the hole.

		If you can’t get into a front rack position to front squat, then use the cross arm grip.

		Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

		Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.

		Don’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe."

Jumps, such as the single leg hop, fall under a form of training known as plyometrics that works on building reactive strength. The reaction stems from generating power once you’ve come in contact with the ground.","
		Setup in a comfortable athletic position with the feet at roughly shoulder width apart and your arms by your sides.

		Shift your weight to one leg and lift the unsupported leg off the floor.

		Descend quickly to a quarter squat position and extend your arms behind your torso.

		Drive upwards and land softly by absorbing the impact with the hips and knees.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		The goal here is speed but also control. If you aren’t jumping and landing in the same spot than perhaps you need to slow down the movement or work to improve your single leg strength.

		Drive the arms upwards, they will lead the legs.

		Don’t forget to drive your non weight bearing knee up as you jump. This may take some practice as research has shown that more experienced jumpers will be able to coordinate movement of the limbs more efficiently to exert a true maximal effort as compared to inexperienced jumpers.


				Also, think about driving the opposite arm and knee up. So, for example - if you’re jumping off your right leg, you would want to drive your left knee and right arm up while driving your left arm back. This will mimic a similar arm motion which is used in sprinting as well as normal gait.


						This patterning is somewhat complex and if you’re just learning these hops for the first time it will take quite some time to acquire so don’t get frustrated.





		Keep your hands relax and the arms fluid.

		Think about trying to push the floor away as you jump."

		If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your spine neutral and load the front leg more effectively.

		If the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position.

		Repeat on the other side.","
		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		Do not allow yourself to fall into overextension, keep tension through the abs.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.

		Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.

		Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body.

		If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

		If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”."

It is an exercise used to strengthen the entire posterior chain including the hamstrings, back, calves, glutes, and traps.
The deficit used when performing deficit deadlifts increases the range of motion during the exercise and thus increases the time under tension placed on the targeted muscle groups.","
		Stand on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor.

		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		For a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:


				The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.

				You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.

By incorporating the use of chains, you provide variable resistance during the lift. This means the deadlift becomes more difficult the closer you get to lock out.
As each chain link rises from the ground, more resistance will be applied to the bar. This can be especially helpful in overloading the top portion of the movement.
Applying chains to lifts is commonly seen among powerlifters and sports-performance training, but can be applied to any training program if your goal is to build muscle and strength.","
		Select your weight and load the bar. Once the bar has been loaded, attach chains to the bar to add additional resistance.

		Ensure that the chains are loaded in between the feet and the plates by either draping them over the bar or attaching them as a loop with a clip, this will prevent the chains from hitting the plates as you set the bar down. You could also attach them to the end of the bar on both ends using clamps. Either option is viable but depending upon what equipment is available, you may have to adapt your chain positioning.

		By adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting off the floor.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Setup in a supine position with both feet elevated on a physioball and your arms extended out to the sides. Position your other leg vertically pointing at the ceiling.

		Initiate the movement by flexing your glutes and extending the hips until you have a straight line from your heel through your head.

		While keeping your hips extended, curl your heels towards your butt by flexing your hamstrings.

		Pick one foot up off the ball and slowly extend the other leg to the starting position.

		SHELC = Supine Hip Extension Leg Curl

		When extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back. If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension.

		If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.

		If you want to improve activation of your abs and hamstrings within the movement, consider squeezing something like a foam roller or yoga block in between your knees. Keep the hips up but also press into the roller/block as you curl the legs in.

		Before progressing into the unilateral version of the SHELC, it would be wise to use this variation as a progression into the most advanced version."

The main difference between a snatch grip deadlift and other deadlift variations is the grip placement.
The snatch grip deficit deadlift utilizes a very wide grip, which is perfect for those seeking to provide additional tension on the traps when deadlifting.
The use of the deficit as seen in the snatch grip deficit deadlift increases the range of motion of the deadlift. This can help lifters build a stronger deadlift, especially if they struggle with the bottom portion of the lift.","
		Stand on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor.

		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a double overhand snatch grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		For a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Given the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant.

		The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:


				The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.

				You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.

The main difference between the banded trap bar deadlift and other deadlift variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body.
These slight changes seen in the banded trap bar deficit can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.
The band used when performing banded trap bar deadlifts provides accommodating resistance. This means the closer one gets to a full contraction during the exercises, the more tension is placed on the targeted muscle groups.","
		Once plates have been loaded on the bar, loop a band on one end of the bar and stretch it across to the other end.

		Stand inside of the trap bar on top of the bands with a hip width stance.

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion.

The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:


				The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.

				You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.



		If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

The main difference between the trap bar Romanian deadlift and other Romanian deadlift variation is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body.
These slight changes seen in the trap bar Romanian deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.","
		Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance.

		Assume a neutral grip on the handles and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.

		Begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the range of motion to control that much range of motion effectively.

		It may be easier to utilize the trap bar given the load is distributed on both sides of the body rather than in front. Since this is the case, it can be thought of as a progression into normal RDLs.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Do not allow the bar to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights."

The exercise ball hamstring curl provides several unique challenges. For example, it challenges the core to stabilize the spine as you contract your hamstrings to bring the exercise ball towards the body.
Also, as a bodyweight exercise that requires a lot of core stability, it is a self-limiting exercise. This means, you’re less likely to cheat as you would if trying to increase weight used in a weighted exercise. Instead, your goal should be to execute the exercise with perfect form before progressing to a more challenging single leg variation.","Setup in a supine position with your feet elevated on a physioball and your arms extended out to the sides.
Initiate the movement by flexing your glutes and extending the hips until you have a straight line from your heels through your head.
While keeping your hips extended, curl your heels towards your butt by flexing your hamstrings.
Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","SHELC = Supine Hip Extension Leg Curl
When extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back. If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension.
If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.
If you want to improve activation of your abs and hamstrings within the movement, consider squeezing something like a foam roller or yoga block in between your knees. Keep the hips up but also press into the roller/block as you curl the legs in.
Don’t allow the hips to swivel as you curl the legs in."

This particular exercise is often used as an activation or warm up exercise for the glutes and performed prior to your main workout/compound lift.

		Setup in a supine position with your knees bent and hands by your sides.

		Pull one knee to your chest and hold it.

		Bridge the hips up by driving your down foot into the floor.

		Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side for the desired number of repetitions before switching sides.","
		Initially you will likely have to hold the knee in place with your hands but as you get stronger, you can progress the exercise by holding the leg in place using a static contraction of the hip flexor.

		With any sort of glute bridging variation, it’s important that you don’t allow the hips to drop or rotate as you are complete repetitions. Single leg variations require higher levels of hip and core stability and as such, they may need to be regressed until the individual demonstrates appropriate levels of strength.

		If you find that the hamstrings are overactive during the movement, seek to drive through the heel directly and keep most of the weight towards the posterior aspect of your foot.

		Don’t arch the back as you bridge the hips, the movement should take place directly through the hip joint and the spinal position shouldn’t change at all."

It is an exercise used to strengthen the entire posterior chain including the hamstrings, back, calves, glutes, and traps.
The band used when performing banded sumo deadlifts provides accommodating resistance. This means the closer one gets to a full contraction during the exercises, the more tension is placed on the targeted muscle groups.","
		Once plates have been loaded on the bar, loop a band on one end of the bar and stretch it across to the other end.

		Stand on top of the band, position the bar over the top of your shoelaces, and assume a very wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.

		The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes.
The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).
The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core.
The conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program.
For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there.
Some of these deadlift variations include:


		Trap Bar Deadlift

		Romanian Deadlift

		Stiff Leg Deadlift

		Landmine Deadlift

		Dumbbell Deadlift

		Smith Machine Deadlift

		In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:


				The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.

				You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.



		If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

		Razor curls are typically used as a progression to GHRs so if you struggle to complete normal GHRs then you can use this variation which shortens the lever arm.

		Band variations are helpful in enhancing overload near lockout as this is where the largest portion of tension from the band is applied as it is stretched.

		Refrain from locking out your knees at the bottom of the movement to keep tension through your hamstrings.

		If desired you can take the hips into flexion in the bottom portion of the movement as this will help to enhance glute activation.

While the American deadlift does primarily target the hamstring complex, it also is great for strengthening the glutes through a focused contraction at the top of the lift.
The American deadlift allows one to keep a more straight and neutral spine when compared to other straight legged deadlift variations.","
		Set a bar at just below hip height and load your desired weight.

		Hinge forward slightly and grasp the bar with a double overhand, shoulder width grip.

		Stand up by extending your hips and knees and take two steps back from the rack.

		Unlock your knees, push your hips back, and hinge forward until the bar is just below your knee cap.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Finish the movement by squeezing the glutes and posteriorly tilting the pelvis.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Do not allow the bar to drift away from your body during the lift.

		Powerlifters may sometimes refer to these as “Dimel deadlifts”.

		In the words of Bret Contreras, “You can think of the American deadlift as a glute-centric RDL”.

		Keep soft knees and ensure the movement occurs primarily at your hips. There shouldn’t be any movement within your spine - don’t focus on arching your back.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Do not worry about retracting your shoulder blades, this is unnecessary and doesn’t carry over to your deadlift.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		When you hip hinge, you should naturally notice a weight shift to your heels. However, don’t shift your weight so aggressively that your heels come up.

		To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbows doesn’t break neutral."

		Ensure you grab the ankle and NOT the sole of the foot. Pulling on the sole of the shoe will place unnecessary stress on the lateral portion of the ankle which is most susceptible to ankle sprains. Remember, ankle and knee - you shouldn’t be touching your shoe.

		As you pull the leg upwards, ensure your chest does not round. Think about driving your head towards the ceiling as you lift.

		Ensure the back knee is extended as some have a tendency to keep a slight amount of flexion.

		You may receive additional benefit from completing a calf raise as the pull the leg up during the movement. This can help to mobilize the ankle as you are improving hip mobility on the opposite leg."

It will also indirectly target the other muscles of the leg, as well as the lats, forearms, traps, and lower back.
The trap bar deadlift is often seen as a quad dominant variation of the deadlift, and while it does incorporate the quads to a larger degree than some other deadlift variations, it still is a hip hinge movement. And hip hinges should be primarily felt through the hamstrings and glutes.
The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.
The trap bar deadlift is best utilized during your leg workouts and/or full body workouts.","
		Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance.

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Stance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.

		In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.

		To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

Using the tiger tail on the hamstrings is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout, especially if you plan to perform lower body exercises that require the hamstrings to be more mobile.
When you perform SMR on your hamstrings, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.","
		While in a seated position, position the tiger tail on the underside of the thigh with one hand on either handle.

		Adjust pressure into hamstrings by applying more or less force through the hands.

		Slowly roll up and down the length of one side of the thigh for 20-30 seconds.

		Repeat on the other side.","
		Given that there are hamstrings located on both the medial and lateral aspects of the thigh, you may need to tilt the roller slightly to target one group (medial/lateral) more than the other.

		Since the hamstrings cross the knee and the hip, experiment with rolling them out while keeping the knee bent or straight.

		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.


				In addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.



		Foam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.


				HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

		If have access to an actual nordic hamstring curl machine that would be ideal. If not, try to utilize a lat pulldown machine as that is the easiest option to adapt for setup. If neither option is available, consider the partner assisted version. If you don’t have access to anyone who can hold your ankles in place, consider a setup with a power rack whereby your ankles are positioned underneath the squat pad on a weighted barbell and you have a pad underneath your knees.

		You can also wrap the band around your chest if you prefer a hands free version. However, if you grab the band behind the head you can modify where your hands are placed, thus allowing yourself more or less assistance as needed.

		Ideally you should look to keep your hips extended throughout the duration of the set, don’t allow them to shoot back and take tension off of your hamstrings.

		Remember, bands return what is requested - the more you stretch them, the more they assist you. If you need more, simply grip higher on the band.

		When extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back. If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension."

The other difference is the fact that the single leg snatch grip Romanian deadlift is a unilateral exercise. This allows you to target each side of the body at a time to build a more aesthetic physique as well as balanced strength.","
		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.

		Assume a double overhand snatch grip just outside of hip width and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.

		Begin the RDL by lifting one foot, unlocking your knee, and slowly hinging back into your hip.

		Push through the floor and extend the hip as you return to the starting position.

		Reset and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Focus on pushing your heel back as far as possible and hinging into the hip rather than dropping your chest.

		Don’t allow the hips to rotate, you should be able to balance a cup of water on your back in the bottom of the movement.

		Your chin should follow your chest, don’t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement.

		Ideally you should keep a straight line from your head through your heel.

		Keep a soft bend in your knee and don’t allow your arch to collapse as you complete the movement.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.

		Don’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		To learn and master single RDLs, it may be conducive to utilize assisted versions by lightly holding onto a rack with your free hand or hinging with both legs in position like a normal RDL but keep one foot hovering off the floor."

The RDL has long been thought of as the “leg” deadlift variation, despite all hip hinge movements primarily targeting the hamstrings. A smart option, to increase training frequency and work on the movement pattern, would be to perform RDLs on your leg day and another deadlift variation on your back or pull days.
The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.
The landmine implement provides a somewhat fixed movement pattern to take some of the stress of the stabilizing muscle groups to help emphasize hamstring usage and limit potential injuries from other variations.
The landmine RDL is best utilized during your leg workouts and/or full body workouts.","

		Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel."

The main difference between a snatch grip deadlift and other deadlift variations is the grip placement.
The snatch grip deadlift utilizes a very wide grip, which is perfect for those seeking to provide additional tension on the traps when deadlifting.","
		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a double overhand snatch grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Given the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant.

		The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:


				The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.

				You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.

		Refrain from locking out your knees at the bottom of the movement to keep tension through your hamstrings.

		If you don’t have access to valslides then you can use a slide board, towel, or even paper plates on a slick surface such as a wood floor."

The use of bands when performing reverse band sumo deadlift provides assistance while you’re at the bottom of the movement. This can be helpful if you’re trying to overload the top portion of the movement without fear of failing to pull the weight off the ground.
Reverse band sumo deadlifts are primarily used by the powerlifting community, but can be used by any training population looking to improve their overall deadlift personal record.","
		Once the bar has been loaded, attach bands to the top of the rack via pegs or the actual rack itself and then anchor the end of the bands around the bar to provide assistance.

		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		By adding bands to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the bands will stretch most in the bottom and least at the top. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the assistance from the band, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck off the floor.

		Ideally you would want to attach two bands across the bar using pegs on a deadlift platform or rack. However, if that option isn’t available, you can simply loop a single band around end, stretch it underneath the plates, and then loop it around the other side.


				If that isn’t comfortable, you can also stand on one end of the band, wrap it around the bar, and step on the other end. This option is slightly more dangerous though as there is a good chance that the band might slide out from underneath your feet and present a potential injury risk. Again, this will depend upon the available equipment but ideally try to prioritize safety over everything.



		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.

		The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

		You should feel this primarily through your glutes and hamstrings. If you’re getting a lower back pump then odds are, you’re dealing with a core/pelvis stability issue.


				If you find that you struggle with keeping a neutral spine then you can regress to something such as valslide leg curls or eccentric only GHRs.



		Razor curls are typically used as a progression to GHRs so if you struggle to complete normal GHRs then you can use this variation which shortens the lever arm.

		Refrain from locking out your knees at the bottom of the movement to keep tension through your hamstrings.

		If desired you can take the hips into flexion in the bottom portion of the movement as this will help to enhance glute activation. However, this also increases the complexity of the movement and many folks will extend through the lumbar spine rather than the hips, thus putting themselves in a poor position to complete the GHR efficiently."

By incorporating the use of chains, you provide variable resistance during the lift. This means the trap bar deadlift becomes more difficult the closer you get to lock out.
As each chain link rises from the ground, more resistance will be applied to the bar. This can be especially helpful in overloading the top portion of the movement.
Applying chains to lifts is commonly seen among powerlifters and sports-performance training, but can be applied to any training program if your goal is to build muscle and strength.","
		Select your weight and load the bar. Once the bar has been loaded, attach chains to the bar to add additional resistance.

		Step inside the trap bar, push your hips back, and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip.

		Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Refrain from locking out your knees at the bottom of the movement to keep tension through your hamstrings.

		If desired you can take the hips into flexion in the bottom portion of the movement as this will help to enhance glute activation. However, this also increases the complexity of the movement and many folks will extend through the lumbar spine rather than the hips, thus putting themselves in a poor position to complete the GHR efficiently."

Adding pauses, as seen in the paused sumo deadlift, is an effective intensity technique used to strengthen the target muscle groups. The pause increases the time under tension of the targeted muscle groups and forces the lifter to really be able to control the weight they are using.","
		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a very wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Pause for a 2 count as soon as the plates break the floor.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		The length and location of the pause will vary based upon your sticking point and what you’re trying to accomplish by utilizing the lift.

		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.

		The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.

		The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors."

		In a seated position, place the foam roller directly underneath your thigh between your knee and hip.

		Support yourself using your hands and free leg. Adjust pressure into the roller by applying more or less force through the forearms and knee.

		Slowly roll up and down the length of the hamstring while slightly rotating the leg periodically for 20-30 seconds.

		Repeat on the other side.","
		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		Do not allow yourself to fall into excessive flexion, keep tension through the abs.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.

		Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.

		Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body.

		If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea."

		Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively.

		It is typically recommended that you utilize straps or hook grip when going excessively heavy if grip is the limiting factor as you could run into issues with the bar drifting if using mixed grip.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.

		To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

It also challenges the grip strength of the lifter who now must grasp the thickest portion of the barbell.
The other difference is the fact that the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a unilateral exercise. This allows you to target each side of the body at a time to build a more aesthetic physique as well as balanced strength.","

				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.

		Don’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights."

It is an exercise used to strengthen the entire posterior chain including the hamstrings, back, calves, glutes, and traps.
The deficit used when performing Sumo deficit deadlifts increases the range of motion during the exercise and thus increases the time under tension placed on the targeted muscle groups.
This can be helpful for lifters looking to build a stronger deadlift, but struggle with the bottom portion of the lift.","
		Stand on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor.

		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a very wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.

		Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		For a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run.

		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.

		The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors."

		Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

The use of bands when performing reverse band deadlift provides assistance while you’re at the bottom of the movement. This can be helpful if you’re trying to overload the top portion of the movement without fear of failing at your weaker part of the lift.
Reverse band deadlifts are primarily used by the powerlifting community, but can be used by any training population looking to improve their overall deadlift personal record.","
		Once the bar has been loaded, attach bands to the top of the rack via pegs or the actual rack itself and then anchor the end of the bands around the bar to provide assistance.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		By adding bands to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the bands will stretch most in the bottom and least at the top. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the assistance from the band, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck off the floor.

		Ideally you would want to attach two bands across the bar using pegs on a deadlift platform or rack. However, if that option isn’t available, you can simply loop a single band around the end, stretch it underneath the plates, and then loop it around the other side.


				If that isn’t comfortable, you can also stand on one end of the band, wrap it around the bar, and step on the other end. This option is slightly more dangerous though as there is a good chance that the band might slide out from underneath your feet and present a potential injury risk. Again, this will depend upon the available equipment but ideally try to prioritize safety over everything.



		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”).

It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.

		More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.

		For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.

		The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:


				The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.

				You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.



		If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

Having tight lats can affect a number of movement patterns, especially front squats and overhead presses. By performing this drill prior to days where you might train those movements, you’ll allow yourself to keep better form during the movement.","
		In an upright position, reach forward and grasp a squat rack with one hand. Place your free hand on the ribcage to monitor spinal positioning.

		Sit back into your hips and step back with the ipsilateral leg to increase the stretch on lats.

		Slowly lean back and open your hips to intensify the stretch.

		Hold for time, breaths, or repetitions and repeat on the opposite arm.","
		Never stretch to the point of pain or discomfort which causes you to hold your breath. Holding the breath increases global tension and will only work against the effects of the stretch at hand.

		If you’re just feeling a stretch in the front of the shoulder then you’re stretching the anterior capsule and increasing instability within the shoulder - STOP. Work on other movements such as a KB armbar, band dislocates, and soft tissue work with a lacrosse ball.

		Work to control the stretch using your breath - after you rock forward slightly, focus on breathing in that position and increasing the stretch on the pec by inflating the lungs. Focus on completing a set number of breaths and then slowly try to get deeper into the stretch before repeating the process."

Sometimes referred to as the barbell row, the bent over row is a staple movement in most muscle building workouts. Those looking to build muscle utilize the bent over row to target their back, bicep and core muscle. Those in powerlifting and strength circles perform bent over rows to increase their strength on the big 3 movements.
The bent over row is typically used to build and strengthen the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius). However, it requires assistance from muscles of the low back, core, and arms to perform a bent over row correctly.
There are several variations of the bent over row one can and should perform.
Bent over row variations include:


		Dumbbell Bent Over Row

		One Arm Bent Over Dumbbell Row

		Reverse Grip Bent Over Row

		T-Bar Row

		Smith Machine Row

The back is a tricky muscle group to build and strengthen. Sometimes it can help to vary the degree in which you perform the bent over row and well as the hand placement on the bar. Regardless, the bent over row is a great exercise to include in your back workout.","
		Assume a standing position while holding the bar using a double overhand grip.

		Hinge forward until your torso is roughly parallel with the floor (or slightly above) and then begin the movement by driving the elbows behind the body while retracting the shoulder blades.

		Pull the bar towards your belly button until it touches your body and then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position under control.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Experiment with head position and see which option (looking forward vs. packing the neck) works better for you.

		Keep some tone through your abdominals as you pull the bar into your body to ensure you don’t arch excessively through your spine.

		Don’t allow momentum to dictate the movement, control the bar throughout the entirety of each rep.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull.

		Similarly, ensure the shoulder blade moves on the rib cage. Don’t lock the shoulder blade down and just move through the glenohumeral joint."

Throws and toss exercises performed with medicine balls, such as the single leg overhead medicine ball wall tap, are typically used by athletes to build the explosive strength and/or balance necessary for their specific sport.
However, these exercises can be performed by others looking to build their explosive strength or balance.","
		Setup in single leg stance while holding a medicine ball overhead with both hands.

		Exhale, pull the arms forward towards the wall, and tap the medicine ball against the wall.

		Catch the med ball as it returns from the wall and repeat step #2 for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Take note, you will only release the med ball for a split second. It’s not a violent throw, it’s a tap which is designed to drive some instability and reinforce strength in a single leg position.

		With med ball drills, the goal is speed throughout the movement. There are only a few rare instances where one might want to move slowly through a weighted plyometric drill with a medicine ball.


				A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

		With med ball drills, the goal is speed throughout the movement. There are only a few rare instances where one might want to move slowly through a weighted plyometric drill with a medicine ball.


				A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

		To scale the movement, one may have to lower or raise the height of the rings. The closer you are to perpendicular with the floor, the tougher the movement will be.

		If regular repetitions with the addition of chains or a weight vest are too easy, progress by elevating the feet. You can also use an old bookbag if you have it lying around but you should load this on the front of the body instead of the back as that can pull you into excessive extension.

		For other forms of progression, you can add fat grips or utilize single arm versions but just remember, this is about movement quality. Just because an exercise is hard doesn’t mean it’s better, work within your wheelhouse and don’t force progression if you haven’t mastered the fundamentals.

The 1 KB kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull is a combination exercise (combining a sumo deadlift with a high pull) and will target other muscles groups such as the upper back and hamstrings.

		Position the kettlebell between your legs and assume a wider than shoulder width stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the handle of the bell with both hands.

		Inhale, drop your hips, and keep the chest up tall.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		As the kettlebell nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms.

		The kettlebell should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement.

		As the kettlebell returns to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the kettlebell to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spending too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will very wide.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell.

Primarily, the dumbbell floor press will target the muscles of the triceps. The limited range of motion effectively takes the chest somewhat out of the equation of the press.
However, the chest can still be indirectly targeted when using the floor press. Simply focus on squeezing the pecs at the top of the movement.
Floor presses, in generally, are particular helpful for those looking to build stronger triceps to help with locking out more compound press variations. They can also be beneficial for bodybuilders trying to add mass to their triceps.","
		Begin sitting on the floor in an upright position with your legs straight and the dumbbells vertically balanced on the floor.

		Pick up each dumbbell and set it high in your hip crease while maintaining a tight grip.

		Slowly lay back while keeping the dumbbells close to your chest and bend your knees to roughly 45 degrees and move your feet up slightly.

		Press the weights to full extension by contracting your triceps and chest.

		Slowly lower the weight until both elbows touch the floor then press both dumbbells back to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

		To complete the exercise, simply lower the weights to the ground in “controlled drop” fashion. It should be a smooth motion but not one requiring excessive effort or one that puts the shoulder under unnecessary risk.","
		Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.

		Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.

		Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself.

		Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.

		Don’t bounce the elbows off the floor at the bottom of the rep. Doing so may result in injury due to the compressive forces being generated between the weight and the floor.

		Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to excessive arch."

The movement will also indirectly target the muscles of the chest and shoulders.
The close grip bench press is a superior movement when we’re talking about exercises that will pack mass onto your triceps. That said, use of close grips can provide some shoulder and elbow discomfort for some.
This exercise can be included in your tricep workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.","
		Lie flat on a bench and set your hands at shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		The elbows will be tucked more than a normal bench due to the decrease grip width but if you experience shoulder pain during this variation you may have to slightly tweak grip width and elbow tuck to provide more space within the shoulder capsule.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

		Inhale, drop your hips, and keep the chest up tall.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		As the kettlebells nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms.

		The kettlebells should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement.

		As the kettlebells return to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the kettlebells to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spending too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will very wide.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel."

The movement will also indirectly target the muscles of the chest and shoulders.
The close grip bench press is a superior movement when we’re talking about exercises that will pack mass onto your triceps. That said, use of close grips can provide some shoulder and elbow discomfort for some.
This exercise can be included in your tricep workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.","
		Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands at shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

As opposed to targeting the upper traps, as most shrug variations tend to do, the t-bar machine shrug emphasizes the use of the mid and lower trap area. It is important to train them all to have a well develop set of traps.","
		Assume a prone position on a t-bar machine with your chest on the pad.

		Reach forward and grab the handle with a semi pronated grip.

		Contract the traps and retract your shoulder blades together to activate all of the traps. Squeeze hard at the top and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Looking slightly up while shrugging may enhance the contraction as traps help to control movement of the skull. This motion should be smooth and controlled, as a ballistic movement could result in a neck injury.

		The traps tend to respond well to high reps and explosive movements (e.g. snatch grip high pulls) so program your accessory work accordingly.

		Limit momentum and excessive jerking or bouncing of the weight. No one cares about how much you shrug.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward excessively as you squeeze the traps, this can put the neck in a compromised position and result in an injury.

		Adding a pause at the top of the movement can help to enhance the mind muscle connection."

So, when deciding whether or not to perform the one arm lying pronated dumbbell tricep extension over another variation, consider which hand placement feels most comfortable to you.
Training the triceps in a unilateral fashion (one side at a time), as seen in the one arm lying pronated dumbbell tricep extension, is an excellent way to build a balanced and symmetrical pair of triceps.","Select the desired weight from the rack and sit in an upright position on a flat bench.
Lay back keeping the weight close to your chest. Once your back is flat against the pad, press the weights to lockout using a neutral grip.
Rotate the dumbbell to a pronated position (thumbs pointing inward) and lower the weight towards your shoulder by unlocking the elbow.
Once your forearm reaches parallel or just below, drive the dumbbell back to the starting point by extending the elbow and flexing the tricep.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.","Don’t overextend through the lumbar spine, keep your ribcage down by maintaining tension through the abs and glutes.
Using a slow eccentric (lowering portion) of the exercise can help to improve tension and mind muscle connection.
Keep the head in a fairly neutral position, don’t allow the neck to jut forward as this may place excessive pressure on the cervical spine."

The main difference in a trap bar shrug is the hand placement and bar used. By utilizing a neutral hand placement, you’ll be able to maintain proper posture, avoid shoulder impingement, and utilize a heavy load to target the muscles of the traps.","
		Position the safeties just below waist height in a rack.

		Assume a standing position with your body positioned inside of the trap bar.

		Hinge forward, inhale, and grab the bar with a double overhand grip.

		Stand up tall and ensure your spine remains neutral.

		Contract the traps to elevate the shoulders. Squeeze hard at the top and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Looking slightly up while shrugging may enhance the contraction as traps help to control movement of the skull. This motion should be smooth and controlled, as a ballistic movement could result in a neck injury.

		The traps tend to respond well to high reps and explosive movements (e.g. snatch grip high pulls) so program your accessory work accordingly.

		Limit momentum and excessive jerking or bouncing of the weight. No one cares about how much you shrug.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward excessively as you squeeze the traps, this can put the neck in a compromised position and result in an injury.

		Adding a pause at the top of the movement can help to enhance the mind muscle connection."

Some believe that through rotating hand and grip positions, you can target different areas of the tricep. However, this is highly debated with this particular muscle group. So, when deciding whether or not to perform the lying pronated dumbbell tricep extension over another variation, consider which hand placement feels most comfortable to you.","
		Select the desired weight from the rack and sit in an upright position on a flat bench.

		Lay back keeping the weights close to your chest. Once your back is flat against the pad, press the weights to lockout using a neutral grip.

		Rotate the dumbbells to a pronated position (thumbs pointing towards one another) and lower the weights towards your shoulders by unlocking the elbows.

		Once your forearms reach parallel or just below, drive the dumbbell back to the starting point by extending the elbows and flexing the triceps.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Don’t overextend through the lumbar spine, keep your ribcage down by maintaining tension through the abs and glutes.

		Using a slow eccentric (lowering portion) of the exercise can help to improve tension and mind muscle connection.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).

		Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.

		Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.

		Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

		As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.

		Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

		As the bar nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms.

		The bar should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement.

		As the bar returns back to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.

		Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.

		The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.

		To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.

		The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.

		Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.

		You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.



		Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.

		Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.

		Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.

		Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.

		Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.

		If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel."

		If you can’t get your arms completely overhead with your elbows locked out then you may need to address core stability, thoracic extension, or both. Consider looking through the rest of the database for example of exercises which help to improve those.

		If you’re having trouble with only driving off the front leg, then consider pulling up the toes on the back foot. This will shift the weight onto your heel and prevent you from driving off the ball of your foot.

		If you want to emphasize more a pump through one leg versus another, complete all of the repetitions on one side before switching to the other.

		Do not rock forward to initiate the movement. Lean forward over the front leg, drive off the forefoot, control the eccentric, step off, and repeat."

The use of chains, as seen in the back squat to box against chains, allows you to overload the top portion of a lift.
The use of a box limits the range of motion of the squat and provides an external cue on when to reverse the movement.
The back squat to box against chains is a great exercise to use if you’re looking to get stronger on the squat exercise, especially if you struggle while locking out at the top of your reps.","
		Position the bar just below shoulder level and adjust the safety stops right above knee height. Find a box set right at parallel and position 2-3 feet behind you. Once the bar has been loaded, attach chains to the bar to add additional resistance. Ensure that the chains are long enough to actually touch the ground when the bar is racked on your back.

		Place your pinkies on the smooth ring of the barbell.

		Get under the bar and position it at the top of your rear deltoids.

		Unrack the bar, take 2-3 steps back and position your feet at shoulder width.

		Take a deep breath and keep your elbows in line with your torso.

		Descend by simultaneously pushing the hips back and bending the knees.

		Once your butt touches the box, begin to reverse the movement.

		Keep your abs braced and drive your feet through the floor.

		Finish the lift by exhaling as you fully extend the hips and knees.","
		Ensure that the chains are loaded on the ends of the bar and that some links are still touching the floor at the top of the movement.

		By adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck in the hole.

		Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.

		Bend the bar over your back by pulling it down into your traps.

		Experiment with a “false” (i.e. thumbless) grip as this helps to eliminate elbow and wrist issues in some folks.

		Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Imagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back.

		Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

		Drive your traps into the bar and try to squeeze your elbows in towards your body as you reverse the movement out of the hole.

		Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.

		Low bar positioning will require the lifter to sit back into the hips with more forward lean at the torso to recruit the posterior chain more effectively.

		Don’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe."

The clean is an extremely explosive movement that combines an initial deadlift like pull and finishes up with a front squat like push. The middle portion of the movement will involve a lot of muscles of the upper body, with a primary focus being on the shoulders and traps.

		Olympic lifting is about efficiency, not just brute strength.

		Given the difference in hand position, the hips will likely start a little lower in the clean compared to the snatch.

		The difference in cleans and hang cleans is the position which they require the lifter to catch the bar. If you have to catch the bar higher (as in a power clean), you must accelerate it at a much higher rate to ensure the bar reaches the desired height.

		Use this simple jingle to help groove the necessary positions for the snatch:


				Starting position

				Knees back

				Knees forward

				Jump and shrug



		Think “slow off the floor, fast into the hips”.

		Ideally you want the movement to take place in a vertical fashion. Don’t think about pushing the hips forward, think up.

		Work on front squats and RDLs initially before moving into the clean, this will ensure that you’re already strong in a hinge and front rack position.

		Get under the bar and position it at the top of your rear deltoids.

		Unrack the bar, take 2-3 steps back and position your feet at shoulder width.

		Descend by simultaneously pushing the hips back and bending the knees.

		Once your thighs reach parallel with the floor, begin to reverse the movement.

		Keep your abs braced and drive your feet through the floor.

		Finish the lift by exhaling as you fully extend the hips and knees.","
		Ensure that the chains are loaded on the ends of the bar and that some links are still touching the floor at the top of the movement.

		By adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck in the hole.

		Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.

		Bend the bar over your back by pulling it down into your traps.

		Experiment with a “false” (i.e. thumbless) grip as this helps to eliminate elbow and wrist issues in some folks.

		Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

		Imagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back.

		Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

		Drive your traps into the bar and try to squeeze your elbows in towards your body as you reverse the movement out of the hole.

		Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.

		Low bar positioning will require the lifter to sit back into the hips with more forward lean at the torso to recruit the posterior chain more effectively.

		Don’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe."

The military press is an exercise with many names and is often referred to as the shoulder press, overhead press, and strict press.
The military press is used primarily to build the deltoid muscle. It also indirectly targets the other muscles of the shoulder, your triceps, and your core. Since the military press is completed standing up, it involves a lot of core strength to help stabilize the spine while pressing weight overhead.
There are a number of variations to the military press you can use to target the deltoids from different angles and different ways.
These military press variations include:


		Seated Military Press

		Dumbbell Military Press

		Seated Dumbbell Press

		Arnold Press

		Behind The Neck Military Press

		Smith Machine Military Press

Be sure to add a variation of the military press to your shoulder workout to get the benefits from one of the most complete shoulder exercises out there.","
		Adjust the barbell to just below shoulder height then load the desired weight onto the bar.

		Assume a shoulder width stance and place your hands at (or just outside of) shoulder width with a pronated grip on the bar.

		Step underneath the bar and unrack it while keeping the spine in a neutral position.

		Take two steps back, inhale, brace, tuck the chin, then press the bar to lockout overhead.

		Exhale once the bar gets to lockout and reverse the movement slowly while controlling the bar back to your chest.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Reach tall at the top and don’t worry about keeping the shoulders packed down and back.

		Allow the elbows to rotate and point outward at the top of the movement but tuck them tight to the ribcage at the bottom.

		Fight to control the bar from rolling your wrists into extension and think about “rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.”

		Keep momentum out of the movement and don’t add any additional leg drive by flexing and extending the knees.

		Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs as you press. You shouldn’t be leaning back excessively as you press.

		Imagine you’re trying to look out a window at the top, your ears should be in line with your biceps.

		If your shoulders are bothering you during the movement, consider experimenting with a wider grip or utilizing some of the vertical pressing progressions listed on the site.

		You can use a staggered stance to prevent the lower back from arching excessively but if you still can’t control the anterior core then consider using a half kneeling regression shown on the site."

		Set up facing a wall in an athletic base position while holding a medicine ball at waist level with a soft bend in your arms and knees.

		Rotate to one side and load back into the hip.

		Rotate through explosively with the hips and throw the medicine ball into the wall directly in front of you.

		Catch the med ball as it returns from the wall and repeat on the opposite side for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Ensure that you are actually achieving a proper weight shift during the movement. Load into the back hip and then transfer your weight into the front hip as you rotate the hips and shoulders together.

		Push hard off the back leg and ensure that you rotate the hips around the front leg as you come through and finish.

		A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.

		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

		Exhale and pull the band apart until it nearly touches your chest.

		Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Ensure that you exhale as you pull the band apart, this will help to maintain a neutral spine position and prevent you from compensating via hyperextension as you go through repetitions.

		If you want to enhance the exercise even further, focus on pushing the hands apart once the band is fully pulled apart at chest height. This will help to activate a small muscle known as your serratus anterior right beneath your armpit.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull the band apart.

		Keep a slight bend in the elbows, this will allow you to target more of the upper back.

		There are actually 2 correct ways to perform pull aparts, utilize both and program accordingly:


				Movement from both the humerus and the shoulder blade (i.e. retraction)

				Movement from just the humerus (i.e horizontal abduction)

		If you find the front of the sled digging into the floor then you may need to setup slightly lower on the handles and/or ensure that your torso is inclined properly. If you start to get too upright then the sled will likely tilt forward and you’ll increase drag against the floor.

		If you don’t have access to a sled, you can push a car or even a plate across astroturf.

		Some prefer to push with the head down while others would rather look up. This is somewhat personal preference but it will also depend upon the individual and how they present in a resting position.


				If someone exhibits more extension bias then they may want to experiment with looking down as this will help to keep them a bit more neutral.

				If someone exhibits more flexion bias then they may want to experiment with looking up as this will help to drive more extension and keep them a bit more neutral.

As you push, the sled will put concentric tension on the muscles used – making it a perfect exercise for those rehabbing injury, as you don’t have to worry about the eccentric motion of the lift.
Sled pushes can be an extremely beneficial conditioning exercise or they can be used as a strength building exercise depending on how you fit them into your workout routine.","Load the desired weight onto the sled.
Setup in an athletic position with your body inclined into the sled at roughly 45 degrees and your arms extended.
Drive the sled forward by aggressively extending each leg and sprinting forward.
Repeat until you reach the desired number of steps, distance, or time.","You can set up this sled variation in one of two ways:

Attach a belt around your waist and drag the sled behind you.
Push into the sled as your sprint.


There are sled push variations which have the elbows extended or bent. If the elbows are bent then you will load the hips more as you effectively take the upper back out of the equation given you’re shortening the lever arm and taking the shoulders out of flexion. If you keep the elbows locked out then you will have to fight for more thoracic extension during the movement. Neither is right or wrong, just depends on what you’re looking to accomplish.
Remember, with a sprint the goal should be technical proficiency and speed under some load. Not maximal load, some load. Keep it light enough that it doesn’t affect your technique.
If you find the front of the sled digging into the floor then you may need to grip slightly lower on the handles and/or ensure that your torso is inclined properly. If you start to get too upright then the sled will likely tilt forward and you’ll increase drag against the floor.
If you don’t have access to a sled, you can push a car or even a plate across astroturf.
Some prefer to push with the head down while others would rather look up. This is somewhat personal preference but it will also depend upon the individual and how they present in a resting position.

If someone exhibits more extension bias then they may want to experiment with looking down as this will help to keep them a bit more neutral.
If someone exhibits more flexion bias then they may want to experiment with looking up as this will help to drive more extension and keep them a bit more neutral.


Given sled pushes/drags don’t have any eccentric component they can very beneficial to incorporate during rehab, as a method of conditioning which won’t incur excessive soreness or load joints excessively."

Using kettlebells to perform the floor press provides a unique challenge in the form of an untraditional implement. The way kettlebells are designed, the weight is below the handle, allowing for gravity to challenge your grip strength more so than a dumbbell would.
Also, kettlebells can be extremely beneficial in helping lifters maintain neutral grip to alleviate joint pain commonly associated with other implements.","
		Begin in a side lying position with a kettlebell on either side of your body.

		Grasp the handle of one kettlebell with both hands and slowly roll onto your back.

		With your free hand, grasp the other kettlebell and press both to full extension by contracting your triceps and chest.

		Lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		To sit back up, it would be ideal to have another individual grab one of the kettlebells and then roll onto your side, just as you started. If that is not an option, simply lower both bells to the bottom position, lower one to the floor and then roll onto your side to place the other bell on the floor.

		Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.

		Keep the kettlebell handle tilted slightly in at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.

		Squeeze the kettlebell handle as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.

		Do not allow the kettlebells to collide together at the top, this can take some tension off the pecs and also be potentially dangerous if you lose stability at the shoulder.

		Don’t bounce the elbows off the floor at the bottom of the rep. Doing so may result in injury due to the compressive forces being generated between the weight and the floor.

		Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to arch excessively."

		Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:


				If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.

				On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

				Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.

		Performing SMR may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.

		If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

		If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”."

		Slowly roll up and down the length of the adductor (groin) for 20-30 seconds.

		Repeat on the other side.","
		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		Do not allow yourself to fall into hyperextension, keep tension through the abs.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.

		Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.

		Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body.

		If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

		If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”."

The Zottman curl utilizes different hand positioning at different portions of the lift to capitalize on the strength of the lifter and maximize arm growth. The first portion, the regular dumbbell curl, allows the lifter to focus on their bicep strength. The lowering portion, after already using a heavier weight than one would typically use in a dumbbell reverse curl, allows you to overload the forearms.
Using a preacher bench will assist in helping one isolate the biceps and also put the arm in a bit of a forward position to assist with maximum contraction.
Bicep isolation work is particularly helpful for those looking to achieve aesthetics and building a balanced physique.","
		Select the desired weight from the rack, and sit in an upright position with your chest flat against the preacher bench.

		Using a supinated grip, take a deep breath and slowly lower the dumbbells away from your shoulders.

		Once the biceps are fully lengthened, rotate the forearms to a pronated position (palms down) and curl the weight back to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Don’t allow the elbows to shift. Similarly, make sure the shoulder doesn’t shift forward in the socket as you lower the weight.

		Maintain a slight bend in the elbow at the bottom of the movement in order to keep tension through the biceps.

		Rotate the forearms slowly, excessive velocity may cause issues within the elbows or wrists.

		Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.

		There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.

		You should feel a stretch globally across the entire pec which originates at the sternum (breastbone) and inserts into the shoulder. If you’re just feeling a stretch in the front of the shoulder then you’re stretching the anterior capsule and increasing instability within the shoulder - STOP. Work on other movements such as a KB armbar, band dislocates, and soft tissue work with a lacrosse ball.

		Work to control the stretch using your breath - after you rock forward slightly, focus on breathing in that position and increasing the stretch on the pec by inflating the lungs. Focus on completing a set number of breaths and then slowly try to get deeper into the stretch before repeating the process."

		Press back until your get a significant stretch in the pec of the arm overhead.

		Return back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Always use the half kneeling variation first before progressing to the standing version as this version will help to limit excessive rotation within the lumbar spine by disassociating the pelvis (aka one leg in hip flexion while the other in hip extension).

		Watch for a variety of compensations which typically present when someone has excessive tone within the pecs:


				The shoulders will rotate

				The spine will hyperextend

				The arm will internally rotate

				The humerus will pop forward in the socket (typically coupled with shoulder elevated and scapular anterior tilt)



		Ensure that you exhale as you rotate the PVC up and away from you, this will help to cue abdominal engage and prevent you from hyperextending. Also, this can help one to ensure that the scapular moves efficiently on the ribcage rather than just tilting the ribcage back."

		Grasp a dumbbell in one hand using a neutral grip and stand up straight.

		While maintaining an active shoulder position, hold the dumbbell by your side and walk for a designated distance or amount of time.","
		When setting up for the lift, ensure you take a good deep breath to set your shoulder position. The weight will drive your shoulders into scapular depression so you want to ensure that your shoulders are set in a good position prior to lifting the weight.

		If performing a unilateral carry variation, ensure that you’re not leaning to one side as you complete the movement.

		Shrug the shoulder just slightly. Not enough so that it takes above a position of neutral but just enough to offset the weight pulling your shoulders down.

		Walk slowly and ensure a heel-toe pattern.

		Stabilize the weight and don’t allow it to drive you into overextension.

Sled drags can be an extremely beneficial conditioning exercise or they can be used as a strength building exercise depending on how you fit them into your workout routine.","
		Load the desired weight onto the sled and attach a set of handles with a nylon strap.

		Setup in a split stance athletic position with your body inclined away from the sled at roughly 45 degrees and your arms loaded by your torso.

		Press the handles away from your torso by extending the arms.

		Take a few steps forward until you again have sufficient tension on the handles.

		Repeat until you reach the desired number of repetitions, distance, or time.","
		Keep some tension through your midsection as this will prevent you from overextending as you press.

		If you don’t have access to a sled, you can push a car or even a plate across astroturf.

		Some prefer to push with the head down while others would rather look up. This is somewhat personal preference but it will also depend upon the individual and how they present in a resting position.


				If someone exhibits more extension bias then they may want to experiment with looking down as this will help to keep them a bit more neutral.

				If someone exhibits more flexion bias then they may want to experiment with looking up as this will help to drive more extension and keep them a bit more neutral.

		Exhale, press the arms to extension, and aggressively launch the med ball into the wall directly in front of you.

		Catch the med ball as it returns from the wall and repeat step #2 for the desired number of repetitions.","
		With med ball drills, the goal is speed throughout the movement. There are only a few rare instances where one might want to move slowly through a weighted plyometric drill with a medicine ball.


				A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

The use of chains, as seen in the bench press against chains, allows you to overload the top portion of a lift.
The bench press against chains is a great exercise to use if you’re looking to get stronger on the bench press exercise, especially if you struggle while locking out at the top of your reps.","
		Select your weight and load the bar. Once the bar has been loaded, attach chains to the bar to add additional resistance.

		Load the desired weight on the bar and then loop chains around the end of the barbell.

		Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Ensure the chains are loaded on the ends of the bar and that some links are still touching the floor at the top of the movement.

		By adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck off the chest.

		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

Having strong forearms, and training the forearms in multiple ways, will allow you to lift heavier weights in many exercises simply by strengthening your grip.
Performing unilateral movements can also help improve weaknesses, balance your strength and aesthetic physique, and work towards reducing injuries by addressing imbalances in the body.
Forearms can be a resistant muscle to grow and may require a higher training frequency to experience a noticeable difference in forearm strength and size."," 
Grab a dumbbell using a supinated grip (palm facing up) and sit down on the end of a flat bench.
Bending only at the wrists, let the dumbbell drop as far as possible. This is the starting position for the exercise.
Slowly curl the dumbbell towards your body using your wrists. Squeeze the forearm muscles at the top of the movement.
Pause, and then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.

The decline cable fly is particularly good for targeting the stubborn lower portion of your pec muscles. The exercise is best used as an accessory movement to your heavy compound lifts.
This movement can be included into your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, or full body workouts.","
		Set both pulleys as low as possible, position a decline bench in the cable station, and select the desired weight.

		Sit on the end of the flat bench and grasp one handle at a time. Lay back and get into position while holding the handles at chest height.

		Press the handles to lockout while flexing the pecs and extending the elbows.

		Keep a slight bend in the elbows, move entirely at the shoulder joint, and slowly allow the arms to open while the pecs stretch.

		Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Imagine you’re trying to hug a tree while completing the exercise.

		Don’t squeeze the handles excessively tight as this can over recruit the forearms and biceps thereby reducing activation of the pecs.

		Avoid touching or banging the handles together at peak contraction to keep constant tension on the intended muscle groups.

The smith machine decline bench press eliminates some of the need for shoulder stability during the exercise, allowing the lifter to better isolate the chest muscles. The angle used during the decline smith machine bench press also allows one to target the lower portion of the chest.","
		Lie flat on an decline bench inside the smith machine and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and unrack the weight by rotating the bar off the safety pins while maintaining tightness through your upper back.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if you have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

		Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.

		Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.

		Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself.

		Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.

		Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position.

		Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself.

		If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

		With med ball drills, the goal is speed throughout the movement. There are only a few rare instances where one might want to move slowly through a weighted plyometric drill with a medicine ball.


				A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

Utilizing a rotational grip while performing dumbbell bench press can help to alleviate some stress on the elbow joints.
Additionally, the rotational movement pattern can help create more tension on the chest by assisting in the development of mind-muscle connection during the exercise.","
		Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.

		To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.

		Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the handles should be about level with your chest) while rotating the wrists to a neutral position at the bottom (palms facing each other).

		Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position while rotating the wrists back to a pronated position (palms facing toes).

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.

		Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.

		Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself.

		Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.

		Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position.

		Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself.

		If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

		Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to excessive arch.

		Keep your feet flat on the floor and don’t allow the lower body to move during the set."

		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

When you perform smr on the pecs, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.","
		Find your collarbone. Trace the area underneath to the base of your sternum (breastbone) and acromion (tip of the scapula).

		In a prone position, position the lacrosse ball just below the collarbone and roll the length of the bone.

		Support yourself with your free hand and feet.

		Adjust pressure into the roller by raising your hips higher or lower or applying more force through your free hand into the ground.

		Slowly roll up and down the length of the pec for 20-30 seconds. This is a fairly small region so there shouldn’t be a large range of motion.

		Repeat on the other side.","
		The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.

		Do not allow yourself to fall into overextension, keep tension through the abs.

		If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.

		Do not roll the front of the shoulder directly as this can cause irritation to the biceps tendon and anterior capsule.

		Performing SMR may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.

		If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.

		If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”."

The wide grip decline bench press is a variation of the decline bench press that utilizes a slight change in hand positioning to alter the emphasis placed on the target muscle groups. By widening your grip, you emphasize the involvement of the chest to a greater degree when compared to closer grip bench press variations.
The decline angle of the wide grip decline bench press also allows one to focus on the lower portion of the chest muscles which is helpful when trying to build a fuller chest.","
		Lie flat on an decline bench, set your hands well outside of shoulder width, and hook your feet underneath the pad.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to just below your sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

The band suspended kettlebell bench press also indirectly targets the muscles of the shoulders and triceps.
The band suspended kettlebell bench press requires a lot of shoulder stability from the lifter. The kettlebells will dangle from the barbell via resistance bands and each side will sway during the range of motion.
This instability will help strengthen your push muscles and is especially practical when it comes to sports specific performance. They can also be helpful for those who powerlift, as the accommodating resistance provided by the bands and kettlebells will help lifts train through their sticking points.","
		Select your weight and load the bar. Once the bar has been loaded, thread a band around a kettlebell handle, loop the band around the bar, and repeat on both sides.

		Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Hanging band training is very beneficial for increasing shoulder stability within the bench. If you find that you can’t control the bar due to excessive shaking then try to squeeze the bar harder to increase a phenomenon in the shoulder known as irradiation leading to further shoulder stability.

		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		With med ball drills, the goal is speed throughout the movement. There are only a few rare instances where one might want to move slowly through a weighted plyometric drill with a medicine ball.


				A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.

The resistance banded dumbbell bench press is a variation of the dumbbell bench press. It is an excellent option for those looking for a more advanced way to strengthen and build the muscles of the chest.
The resistance band used in resistance banded dumbbell bench press provides a way to keep constant tension on the pecs during the dumbbell bench press. It also gives the lifter different variables of intensity during the exercise, with the most intense resistance coming at the peak contraction at the top of the movement.","
		Loop a band around the palms of your hands and then wrap the band around your back.

		You may need a partner to assist with this part - Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.

		To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.

		Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the handles should be about level with your chest).

		Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.

		Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.

		Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself.

		Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.

		Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position.

		Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself.

		Grasp a dumbbell in each hand using a neutral grip and stand up straight.

		While maintaining an active shoulder position, hold the dumbbells by your side and walk for a designated distance or amount of time.","
		When setting up for the lift, ensure you take a good deep breath to set your shoulder position. The weight will drive your shoulders into scapular depression so you want to ensure that your shoulders are set in a good position prior to lifting the weight.

		If performing an unilateral carry variation, ensure that you’re not leaning to one side as you complete the movement.

		Shrug the shoulders just slightly. Not enough so that it takes above a position of neutral but just enough to offset the weight pulling your shoulders down.

		Walk slowly and ensure a heel-toe pattern.

Throws and toss exercises performed with medicine balls, such as the single leg medicine ball chest pass wall tap, are typically used by athletes to build the explosive strength necessary for their specific sport.
However, these exercises can be performed by others looking to build their explosive strength.","
		Setup in single leg stance while holding a medicine ball at chest level with both hands.

		Exhale, extend the arms, and tap the medicine ball against the wall.

		Catch the med ball as it returns from the wall and repeat step #2 for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Take note, you will only release the med ball for a split second. It’s not a violent throw, it’s a tap which is designed to drive some instability and reinforce strength in a single leg position.

		With med ball drills, the goal is speed throughout the movement. There are only a few rare instances where one might want to move slowly through a weighted plyometric drill with a medicine ball.


				A good rule of thumb - if the weight is so excessive that it affects the technical execution of the movement then it is too much.



		You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.

		Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.

		Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.

		If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.


				However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.

Using boards allows you to overload the top portion of the bench press. This can be especially helpful if you’re trying to train the lockout portion of the lift but get stuck when touching the chest.
Board presses are primarily used by strength competitors and the powerlifting community, but can also be used by anyone trying to build a bigger bench press for whatever reason.","
		Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

		Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

		Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off to maintain tightness through your upper back.

		Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

		Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

		Lower the bar in a straight line until it touches a single board that is being held to your chest by a spotter.

		Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.

		Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.

		If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.

		Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.

		Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.

		As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.

		Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.

		Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.

		Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.

		Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.

		Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.

		Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.

		The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.

		Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.

		Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.

		Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.

		Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.

		Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

		The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

		Extend one leg at a time and assume a push up position with the legs straight, feet wider than shoulder width, elbows extended, and head in a neutral position looking at the floor.

		Remove one hand from the ball and place it behind your back.

		Slowly descend to the floor by retracting the shoulder blades and unlocking the elbows.

		Descend until your chest touches the ball.

		Push back to the starting point by extending the elbows and driving your palms into the ball.

		Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","
		Your spine should remain rigid throughout the entire exercise, think of the push up as a moving plank.

		Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs before descending to keep the ribcage neutral.

		Keep the chin down and don’t look forward.

		Don’t allow the head to jut forward, the chest should touch at the same time as your nose.

		Think about trying to push yourself as far away from the floor as possible.


				Ensure you push all the way through the floor at the top of the repetition and allow your shoulder blades to move around your ribcage.

				Most folks cut the repetition short and don’t garner the full benefits as such.
